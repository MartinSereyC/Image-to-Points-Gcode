# Image-to-Points-Gcode
This code takes a image, makes a grid, select the value of each point of the grid. The user can select in how many leyers to distribute said points acording to light value. The code will generate a Gcode for each layer so it can be plotted. 
The user can: 
  1.-Upload a picture
  2.-Define the umber of layer
  3.-Define the Grid Size
  4.-Define the point diameter to preview the plotted image. This gives the user an idea but the final result depends on paint, tool and medium.
  5.- Define z values for traveling and making the point
  6.- Feed rate of x, y and z axis 
  7.- Choos plot size from A4, A3 and A2

The next step is to press the "Generate G-Code" button. 
Copy and past each gcode for the different layers.
